# Data Analytics Project - Airline Customer Satisfaction

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for analyzing airline customer satisfaction. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of various classification models to evaluate customer satisfaction levels.

## Project Components

- **Literature Review**
  - `Airline Customer Satisfaction final.docx`: This document contains the literature review relevant to the project.

- **Code Files**
  - `airlinesatisfaction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that includes data preprocessing and visualization. The SVM code is integrated here due to long execution times.
  - `knn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model.
  - `adaboosting.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the AdaBoosting classification model.
  - `random_forest.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Random Forest classification model.
  - `naive_bayes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Naive Bayes classification model.
  - `svm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model.
  - `logistic_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Logistic Regression classification model.

- **Final Report**
  - `04_Airline max satisfaction-FinalReport.pdf`: The final report document detailing the project findings and conclusions.

- **Dataset**
  - `Invistico_Airline.csv`: The dataset used for analysis, containing customer feedback and satisfaction metrics.

## Usage

1. **Explore the Code**
