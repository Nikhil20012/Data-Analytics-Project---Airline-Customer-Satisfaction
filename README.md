# Data Analytics Project - Airline Customer Satisfaction

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for analyzing airline customer satisfaction. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of various classification models to evaluate customer satisfaction levels.

## Project Components

- **Literature Review**
  - `Airline Customer Satisfaction final.docx`: This document contains the literature review relevant to the project.

- **Code Files**
  - `airlinesatisfaction.py`: This file includes the preprocessing and visualization code. Note that the SVM code is also included here due to long execution times, which are handled separately.
  - `knn.py`: Contains the code for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model.
  - `adaboosting.py`: Contains the code for the AdaBoosting classification model.
  - `random_forest.py`: Contains the code for the Random Forest classification model.
  - `naive_bayes.py`: Contains the code for the Naive Bayes classification model.
  - `svm.py`: Contains the code for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model.
  - `logistic_regression.py`: Contains the code for the Logistic Regression classification model.

- **Final Report**
  - `04_Airline max satisfaction-FinalReport.pdf`: The final report document detailing the project findings and conclusions.

- **Dataset**
  - `Invistico_Airline.csv`: The dataset used for analysis, containing customer feedback and satisfaction metrics.

## Usage

1. **Explore the Code**
   - Review `airlinesatisfaction.py` for data preprocessing and visualization steps.
   - Use the model files to test and evaluate different classification approaches:
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors**: `python knn.py`
     - **AdaBoosting**: `python adaboosting.py`
     - **Random Forest**: `python random_forest.py`
     - **Naive Bayes**: `python naive_bayes.py`
     - **Support Vector Machine**: `python svm.py`
     - **Logistic Regression**: `python logistic_regression.py`

2. **Read the Final Report**
   - Refer to `04_Airline max satisfaction-FinalReport.pdf` for a comprehensive summary of the project's results and conclusions.
